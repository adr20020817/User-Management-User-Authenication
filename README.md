***FORGOT PASSWORD PAGE*** <br>
When registering the page, a field for entering email is used. Clicking 'Send Code' takes a user to the verify code page, where the user is sent the verification code via email. The user enters the code, and if the code is correct, the user is redirected to create a new password.

For this functionality to work a mail server is needed inside the operating system, or there is an option of using PHPMailer.
